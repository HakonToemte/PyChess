 Server and Client 2 Player Chess game
Using sockets


Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" for installing the required packages (just pygame)

To start playing just run serverChess.py first and let it run.
then run client.py in 2 other terminals. Can use pycharm run-in parallel for this.
You can have more than 2 clients playing at the same time.
