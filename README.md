# PyChess
 Server and Client 2 Player Chess game
Using sockets


Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" for installing the required packages (just pygame)

To start playing just run serverchess.py first
then run client.py in 2 terminals that will automatically connect. Can use pycharm run-in parallel for this.
You can have more than 2 clients playing at the same time.
